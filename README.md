# Hello

I am fullstack developper at [marmelab](https://marmelab.com/fr/), a digital innovation studio based in Nancy (France) but working remote from Strasbourg (France).

I am now shaping mainly Node.js, React and the Javascript/Typescript ecosystem in general after having dedicated myself to more graphic/creative interfaces for more than 10 years.
